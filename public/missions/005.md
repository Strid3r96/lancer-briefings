# Mission // #005
## The Typhon
# Goals
- Infiltrate the Pharos-1 Space Elevator
- Board the VNS TYPHON
- Destroy the ships reactor by any means necessary

# Stakes
- Failure to destroy the TYPHON will leave the hard-line Vestan government in a posiiton to dominate Cressidium's orbit uncontested, and may result in reprisal strikes
- Security measures will doubtless be reinforced in the aftermath of an assault on the ship, rendering future attacks nigh-impossible
- This will endanger any and all resistance efforts until UNION reinforcements can arrive (ETA: 24 Months)

# Reserves
- None at this time.
