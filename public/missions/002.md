# Mission // #002
## Daybreak

# Goals
- Neutralize the enemy's comms jamming network.
- Locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee

# Parameters
- Intel places the nearest transmitter within a nearby financial/commercial district. The area is densely packed with tall buildings, and there are reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets in defense of its strongpoints throughout the city.
- The existence of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal; anticipate systemic invasion and localized sensor jamming/optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities

# Stakes
- If the jamming network is not neutralized on schedule, the LSA advance into Nov Elysia's central district will face heavy resistance, incurring serious casualties which may hinder their ability to retake the city effectively.
- Should locating and securing Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee fail, it will likely result in them being taken prisoner or even killed.

# Reserves
- ~~LSA/UNION Joint Sniper Team~~
- ~~LSA High-Mobility Pack~~
- Sensor Disruption Package
