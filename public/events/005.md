# Resistance Bunker, ~REDACTED~ // 12.23.5016u
The time has finally come. It's been 6 months of hellish fighting against the Vestan's overwhelming onslaught, but a chance to end it all has finally come.
Task Force Indigo is going on their most important mission yet, the one that will determine the future of the war. With plans drawn up, thrown out, and drawn up again, it comes down
to one final attempt. With the help of Vestan civilians, tired and scared of the war, a small group will be smuggled inside shipping containers on to the PHAROS-01 space elevator just
as the Typhon itself docks for a resupply. From there it's a simple straight shot to board the ship, find its reactor, and hopefully bring it all down in a massive ball of fire.

No one knows what truly awaits on board the monster that is the Typhon, but this is the one and only chance they'll get to find out. Suit up, time to get to work Lancers.
