# Mission // #003
## A Day of Firsts

# Goals
- Insert into Vestan Territory and link up with local resistance forces
- Gather additional supplies and equipment as necessary
- Seize control of the suspected TARTARUS facility. Destruction has been approved if necessary

# Parameters
- Clearance granted to engage all hostile targets. Expect strong resistance while operating in enemy territory
- Local Vestan defense patrols are noted to be highly mobile and aggressive; counter-mobility and anti-armor capablities strongly advised

# Stakes
- Inability to assist restance forces will severely diminish their effective capablities
- The TARTARUS facility itself remains a mystery, but failure to take it quickly may result in the loss of valuable intelligence, hostages, and potentially even more serious consequences depending the exact nature of TARTARUS itself

# Reserves
- Sensor Disruption Package
- ~~"Last Chance" Shielding~~
- Enhanced Ammunition
- ~~Sunzi I "Accelerate"~~
- Vacuum Bomb
- Sniper Team
