# UNS-CV RIO GRANDE // 5.13.5016u
Awaiting Captain Farris' return aboard the Rio Grande, the crew is set in to alert upon recieving civil distress signals from Nov Elysia.
It appears during one of the peace conferences that Vestan forces started an assault on the port city while laying down wide spread communication disruptions.
Forgoing normal procedures to mount a rescue operation to retrieve Bannerjee and Cpt. Farris, the Rio Grande launched dropships with marine and chassis elements prepared for a hot drop.

The newly graduated pilots, part of the Kingfisher squad, were among the first to be sent planetside. The descent was met with heavy Anti-Air resistance before the drop ship was skewered by a lance
of light forcing a crash landing. The squad of Kingfisher-2 found themselves in Karmani Plaza, far from their drop site of FOB Saber. Within minutes of gaining their bearings they were set upon by 
Vestan forces coming to investigate the crash site. After a pitched battle they managed to push through the enemy forces and make their way in to the downtown of Nov Elysia. 

Marching through the once pristine city, they found a group of LSA soldiers attempting to repair a civilian bus full of non-combatants. Helping repair the bus they then assisted in escorting the 
civilians to a nearby shelter. Doing their best to avoid direct combat, the squad of Kingfisher 2 unfortuantely had to push through a Vestan encampent that had been set up in the way of the shelter.
