# NOV ELYSIA // 5.14.5016u
Finally managing to rest after their pitched mission, the squad of Kingfisher-2 refits their mechs with new licensed equipment while preparing for their next mission; Take down the communication jamming
effecting the city and retrieve Ambassador Bannerjee and Captain Farris. 

Setting out early in the morning the group takes on their first task of disabling the communications jamming with Rio's gifted code-spike. Managing to thin the enemies out, they succeed in holding the area long
enough for the code-spike to upload, clearing the air. With the jamming lifted, communications among LSA and Union forces crowd the radio as chatter from various battles is finally able to be heard. With this, Rio
is able to determine the location of Captain Farris, moving quickly towards a port within Nov Elysia. Their objective in sight, the squad moves towards the port to save their Captain and the Ambassador.
