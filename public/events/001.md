# UNS-CV RIO GRANDE // 2.21.5016u
While aboard the Rio Grande awaiting news on the latest peace summit happening in the coastal city of Nov Elysia, a shipwide alarm calls everyone to action. Vestan forces had started a surprise assault on the city, 
disrupting the peace summit and kidnapping Ambassador Bannerjee and Captain Farris in the process. A contigent of Marine and Chassis elements were to be deployed planet side for a rescue operation, unable to take part
in a war due to UNION's hands-off policy involving Diasporian worlds.

With orders given and mission parameters laid out, the crew take to boarding their mechs and dropships in preparation for dropping planetside.
