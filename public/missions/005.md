# Mission // #005
## The Typhon

# Goals
- Infiltrate the Pharos 1 space elevator, board the VNS Typhon
- Make your way through the ship towards the main reactor, destroy it by any means necessary

# Parameters
- Anticipate heavy resistance and intense close-quarters combat both within the space elevator and the ship itself
- Due to the area of operations, exoatmospheric/null-grav traversal capabilities are highly recommended

# Stakes
- Failure to destroy the Typhon will leave the hardline Vestan government in a position to continue dominate Cressidium's orbit uncontested, and result in reprisal strikes
- Security measures will doubtless be reinforced in the aftermath of an assault on the ship, rendering future attempts nigh-impossible
- Endagering of resistance efforts until additional UNION reinforcements can arrive (ETA: 24 Months)

# Reserves
- Enhanced Ammunition
- Vacuum Bomb
- Barrier Field Coils
- Overclocked Systems
